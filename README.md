# Software-Foundations-Playground
Happy Hacking Coq!
----

This repo contains my solutions to the [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/index.html)
as well as some [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) and [Proof General](https://proofgeneral.github.io/) configs which is my own
taste.

The code works on coq.8.4.6 with ocaml 4.02.0.

Nor all of the solutions are optimized or correct. Just for fun.
